# Initial deployment — 2026-09-22

## Implemented

- Consolidated trial UI units into persistent `pi-desk.service`, **enabled at boot**.
- Kept `multi-user.target` and the existing pi account; no new account or sudo policy.
- Retired `mac-graphical-terminal.service`, `mac-sessions-trial.service` and the
  transient `mac-session-grid-live` user service; stopped the old local
  `mac-session-panels` tmux server. Mac sessions were not killed or recreated.
- New local socket: `pi-desk`. New manual command: `~/.local/bin/pi-desk`.
- Legacy `mac-sessions` is a compatibility wrapper; obsolete connect/grid/display
  scripts were archived before removal.
- Added per-pane reconnect, pane reconciliation/order recovery, read-only live
  lifecycle feed reconnect and strict freshness handling.
- Retained fullscreen, black background, emoji support, 24/12 pt menu/workspace
  fonts, US keyboard and persistent Wi-Fi power-save disablement.

## Backup

Pi pre-migration snapshot: `~/.local/state/pi-desk/backups/20260922T150937Z/`.
A secret-free archive of that allowlisted snapshot is retained in this project's
`backups/` directory. It excludes SSH configuration/keys, known_hosts, presence
identity files, backend state, session transcripts, and environment files with
credentials. Labwc's keyboard-only environment file is included.

The Mac's previous read-only status helper was separately retained under
`~/.local/state/pi-desk/backups/` before replacement.

## Verified

- **13 tests passed on both Mac and Raspberry Pi**, including fresh/stale/future
  status, invalid telemetry, source projection, retry after failed SSH start,
  group idempotency, missing-middle-pane repair with numeric ordering,
  dead-pane respawn, and session 10 remaining solo.
- `systemd-analyze verify` accepted the installed service.
- `systemctl is-enabled pi-desk.service` → enabled; active, with zero restarts.
- Terminated only the UI's read-only status SSH client: it automatically obtained
  a new PID and resumed its stream.
- Terminated only session 1's Pi-side SSH display client: its wrapper automatically
  reconnected with a new SSH PID; the remote Mac session stayed running.
- Opened group 1 through the graphical menu: all three tagged panes were alive.
  F12 returned to the menu and closed only the workspace display client.
- Old trial units no longer running.
- Presence/audio user services and system Bluetooth/SSH remained active.
- Approximately 658 MiB available memory, 56°C, no active thermal throttle;
  `0x20000` was a historical soft-temperature-limit flag only.

## Still untested deliberately

- **Actual reboot acceptance.** Boot startup is enabled and the service was
  successfully started, but the Pi has not been rebooted to test it. Avoided
  interrupting presence/audio merely to validate this change.
- Prolonged Wi-Fi loss, Mac reboot, and TV hotplug. Retry behaviour is tested
  without deliberately taking the household's network or services offline.

No new public ports, HTTP listeners, household automations, browser installations,
Mac session-layout changes, or credential copies were introduced.
